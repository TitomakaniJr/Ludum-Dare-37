### What is this repository for? ###

This Repository contains all the code for my Ludum Dare 37 Project Voyage.
Voyage is a old-school point and click game revolving around two people that become stranded in space.
As this was a game that was made in 72 hours the code is not extremely well commented, but everything works properly and should be fairly easy to understand.
Voyage can be played at https://titomakanijr.itch.io/voyage
